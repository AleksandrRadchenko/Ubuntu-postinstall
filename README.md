### Bunch of scripts to automate software install on fresh Ubuntu machine

##### Tested
- on Ubuntu 17.10

##### Usage
- `app_example.desktop` - template for Gnome desktop app shortcut,
- `install_idea.sh` - doesn't work for now,
- `post_install.sh` - interactive, run with priveleges,
- `post_install_configuration.sh` - interactive, needs preconfiguration (with text editor),
- `post_install_configuration_sudo.sh` - non interactive, check before run.
